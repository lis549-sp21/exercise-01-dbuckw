    <h1>Lowell Mather</h1>
    <p>Lowell Mather, played by Thomas Haden Church, is the enigmatic, well-meaning mechanic-savant employed by the small fictional Nantucket airport, Tom Nevers Field, which serves as the setting for the classic 1990s sitcom <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wings_(1990_TV_series)">Wings</a>. Lowell's good-natured naivete, blunt manner, and general lack of sophistication paired with his sporadically-revealed aptitudes--ranging from fluency in French to mastery of haute cuisine--are frequent sources of humor in the show.</p>

<p>What makes Lowell a great character?</p>
<ul>
    <li>Much of Lowell's likeability stems from his honesty--what he lacks in subtlety, he makes up for in trustworthiness.</li>
    <li>Lowell is also a remarkably well-rounded individual with a degree from MIT (Murray's Institute of Tools), and he has the ability to appreciate all the finer things in life, from fine French cooking to shooting rats at the local dump.</li>
    <li class="cherry-red">Perhaps most importantly, one cannot help but appreciate the combination of Lowell's unfailing industriousness and generous nature.</li>
</ul>
